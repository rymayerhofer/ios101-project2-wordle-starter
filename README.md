# Project 2 - *Wordle Pt. 2*

Submitted by: **Ryan Mayerhofer**

**Wordle Pt. 2** is a game where in each round, one is given a secret word to guess and a limited number of chances to do so. With each guess, they receive clues that indicate which letters are included in the word and where they're located before running out of attempts. It allows the user to change the length of the word, the number of guess, the genre of word. It also includes a harder "Alien" mode.

Time spent: **1** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] User can change the number of letters per row (the length of the goal word)
- [x] User can change the numbers of rows on the board (how many guesses allowed)
- [x] User can select a new themed set to pull the goal word from
- [x] User can select "alien wordle", causing the goal word to change after each guess

## Notes

This week was much easier! All of the code was stuff I felt I knew and understood. I also had much less troubles with GitHub because of the trail and error I went through last week.
